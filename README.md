# cards_go
a simple cards project to learn Go. 

End goal is a interactive games of Ride the Bus, Blackjack, and whatever other card games I can understand. :)

Planned iterations:
1) Guess that card! - using structs, slices, loops, and other simple structures. Complete with testing
2) Load/Save a deck from/to file
3) Build out Guess that card into Ride the bus
4) Black jack - have both games be of type interface - Game and get some practice with interfaces
