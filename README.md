# cards_go
a simple cards project to learn Go. 

End goal is a interactive games of Ride the Bus, Blackjack, and whatever other card games I can understand. :)

Planned iterations:
1) Guess that card! -  Write up some testing for these 
2) Black jack - have both games be of type interface - Game and get some practice with interfaces
